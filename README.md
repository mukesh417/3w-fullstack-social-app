# 3W Full Stack Social App 🚀

A full-stack social media application built as part of the **3W Full Stack Internship Assignment**.  
Users can register, log in, create posts, like posts, and comment — similar to a basic social feed.

The project demonstrates **end-to-end full stack development**, authentication, protected routes, and deployment on cloud platforms.
